Overall Objective: To identify, evaluate, and rank at least 6 "Handwerker" (tradespeople, craftsmen, artisans) businesses within the Munich city area that are prime candidates for web design services due to significant, AI-assessable deficiencies in their current websites. The focus is on websites that would genuinely benefit from a professional redesign, considering technical aspects, content quality, and outdated technology.
Your Role: You are an advanced Lead Generation AI, specialized in web presence analysis for a Munich-based web design agency. You will leverage your Deep Research capabilities to conduct thorough investigations.

Phase 1: Lead Discovery & Initial Filtering
Your goal is to find potential "Handwerker" websites in Munich that show initial signs of neglect or poor quality.
1. Targeted Search & Discovery:
    * Utilize search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) and local business directories (e.g., Gelbe Seiten, local Munich business portals).
    * Primary German Search Terms:
        * "Handwerker München"
        * "Schreiner München"
        * "Elektriker München"
        * "Maler München"
        * "Sanitär München"
        * "[Specific Trade] München Handwerk"
        * "Webseite [Specific Trade] München veraltet" (Website [trade] Munich outdated)
    * Filtering Strategy:
        * Prioritize websites appearing beyond the first two pages of primary search engine results (e.g., Google), as these often have optimization issues.

        * Look for visual cues of outdated design (e.g., designs reminiscent of early 2000s, non-responsive layouts if immediately apparent, old HTML conventions).
        * Check for copyright dates in footers; significantly old dates (e.g., 2-3+ years without update) can be an indicator.

Phase 2: In-Depth Website Audit (AI-Powered Evaluation)
For each identified website, conduct a thorough audit based on criteria AI can reliably assess. Leverage your Deep Research functions to analyze source code, network requests, and simulate user experiences.
1. Technical & Performance Assessment:
    * Mobile Responsiveness:
        * Verify if the site uses a responsive meta-viewport tag.
        * Analyze CSS for media queries and flexible layouts.
        * Simulate rendering on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to confirm true adaptability.
    * Page Load Speed:
        * Utilize simulated network conditions or integrate with tools like Google PageSpeed Insights (via function calling if available, or by interpreting its metrics).
        * Flag sites with Core Web Vitals issues, particularly LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) > 2.5s, FID (First Input Delay) > 100ms, and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) > 0.1.
        * Specifically note load times above 3 seconds for key pages (homepage, services) on both desktop and mobile.
    * Broken Links & Errors:
        * Systematically crawl the website to identify broken internal and external links (404 errors).
        * Check browser console for JavaScript errors or other critical resource loading failures.
    * SSL Certificate: Confirm the presence and validity of an HTTPS certificate.
    * Website Technology Stack:
        * Identify the underlying technology (e.g., WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Wix, Squarespace, custom HTML/PHP, specific frameworks).
        * Flag significantly outdated technologies:
            * Obsolete CMS versions (if detectable).
            * Use of Flash.
            * Deprecated HTML tags or very old JavaScript libraries (e.g., outdated jQuery versions).
            * Check server response headers for clues about outdated server software (e.g., old PHP versions).
2. Content & UX Elements Assessment:
    * Presence of Key Information:
        * Verify clear and easily accessible contact information (phone number, physical address, email address).
        * Check for a functional contact form or prominent mailto: links.
    * Content Quality & Structure (AI-Assisted):
        * Readability & Clarity: Assess for overly complex sentences, jargon without explanation, or poorly structured text that hinders comprehension for a typical customer.
        * Professionalism: Identify significant grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, or unprofessional tone.
        * Relevance & Sufficiency: Does the content adequately describe services, showcase expertise, and build trust? Is there "thin content" on key service pages?
        * Call-to-Actions (CTAs): Are there clear CTAs guiding users? Or are they missing/ineffective?
        * SEO Basics: Is there a discernible use of relevant keywords for their trade and location? Are title tags and meta descriptions present and somewhat optimized (or clearly absent/poor)?
    * Social Media Integration: Determine if links to active social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) are present and functional.

Phase 3: Content Extraction for Redesign Proposal
If a website is deemed a strong candidate for redesign based on the audit, extract the following information. Prioritize elements essential for recreating the website with an improved design while preserving the Handwerker's unique identity, services, and craftsmanship.
* Core Textual Content: All headings, body copy, service descriptions, project details, "About Us" / company history, team member profiles, mission statements, certifications, customer testimonials, business hours, and all contact information.
* Service/Product Listings: Detailed lists of services or products offered, including pricing if available.
* Unique Selling Propositions (USPs): Any text highlighting what makes the Handwerker unique (e.g., specializations, years of experience, unique methods).
* Visual Assets:
    * Company logo(s).
    * High-quality images of completed projects, team members, workshop/location.
    * If direct scraping is difficult, list the URLs of these key images. Pay special attention to images showcasing craftsmanship.
* Site Structure Indicators: Note the number of main services or product categories to estimate the scope for a new website.

Phase 4: Lead Qualification, Justification & Ranking
1. Justification for Redesign:
    * For each qualified lead, provide a concise justification explaining why their website needs improvement, referencing specific findings from the Phase 2 Audit.
    * Tailor the explanation to how these deficiencies negatively impact their ability to attract and serve potential clients in Munich.
    * Crucially, also identify any existing strengths or valuable content/imagery that should be preserved or enhanced in a redesign. This shows understanding and provides value.
2. Lead Scoring & Ranking System (1-10, 10 = Highest Need/Priority):Assign a "Redesign Urgency Score" based on the severity and combination of issues. Consider these factors (weights can be implied or explicitly defined for your internal logic):
    * Critical Technical Issues : No SSL, major mobile unresponsiveness, extremely slow speed (>5s LCP), widespread broken links.
    * Outdated Technology : Use of Flash, very old CMS/frameworks posing security risks or severe limitations.
    * Poor UX & Content : Difficult navigation, very poor readability/grammar, lack of clear CTAs, missing key contact info, thin or irrelevant content.
    * Aesthetic & Minor Technical Issues : Visibly outdated but functional design, minor speed issues (3-4s LCP), few broken links.
    * No Social Media / Poor SEO Signals : If other major issues are present, these add to the score.Any other aspects : Analyse the page with your own capabilities, to verify its quality. Use everything you can think of.
3. The AI should synthesize these factors into a single score. For example:
    * Score 9-10: Multiple critical issues, website is actively harming business.
    * Score 7-8: Significant issues across technical & content; clear need for redesign.
    * Score 5-6: Several moderate issues or one critical issue; strong candidate.
    * Score <5: Minor issues, may not be a priority lead unless combined with other business intelligence.

Phase 5: Output Structure
Generate a report listing at least 6 qualified leads, ordered by their Redesign Urgency Score (highest first). For each lead, provide:
1. Business Name:
2. Website URL:
3. Redesign Urgency Score (1-100):
4. Brief Summary of Deficiencies (Handwerker-Focused): A 2-3 sentence summary explaining the main problems in a way a tradesperson would understand (e.g., "Your website is hard to use on phones, making it difficult for new customers to contact you," or "The site loads very slowly, and potential clients might give up before seeing your excellent work.").
5. Detailed Audit Findings:
    * Technical Issues: (List specific findings: Mobile responsiveness, Page Speed, Broken Links, SSL, Outdated Technology details)
    * Content & UX Issues: (List specific findings: Key Information, Content Quality, CTAs, Social Media)
6. Strengths to Preserve: (Briefly note any good content, images, or aspects of their current site).
7. Structured Extracted Content:
    * Key Text Snippets (About Us, Services Summary, USPs)
    * List of Services/Products
    * Image URLs (for key visuals like logo, projects)
    * Contact Information

Execution Guidelines:
* Ensure all identified businesses are genuinely located within the Munich city area.
* Focus on AI-reliable, objective assessments. Avoid overly subjective aesthetic judgments unless directly tied to usability or outdatedness (e.g., Flash).
* Prioritize quality over quantity beyond the minimum of 6 leads. Each lead should be well-vetted.
* Leverage your Deep Research capabilities to be thorough and accurate.
