Create a comprehensive pre-launch checklist for a [TYPE_OF_PRODUCT_OR_PROJECT - e.g., new software application, marketing campaign, website redesign].
The checklist should cover the following categories:
1. Content Review: (e.g., proofreading all text, checking links, verifying information accuracy)
2. Technical Checks: (e.g., testing functionality on different devices/browsers, performance testing, security checks)
3. Design & UX: (e.g., consistency of branding, mobile responsiveness, accessibility compliance)
4. Legal & Compliance: (e.g., privacy policy updated, terms of service clear, necessary disclaimers present)
5. Marketing & Communication: (e.g., announcement plan, social media posts drafted, press release ready)
6. Analytics & Tracking: (e.g., tracking codes implemented, goals set up in analytics tools)

For each item on the checklist, provide a brief description of what needs to be verified.
Aim for at least 3-5 checklist items per category.
Example for [TYPE_OF_PRODUCT_OR_PROJECT] = "new mobile app".
