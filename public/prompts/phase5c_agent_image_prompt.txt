Using your advanced Agent Mode capabilities, analyze the existing website and strategically integrate 1-2 high-impact, custom-generated images that will significantly enhance business credibility, user engagement, and conversion potential. Focus on areas where visual elements can replace or enhance text-heavy content with maximum strategic impact.
STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS & TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Business Intelligence Gathering

Deep Content Analysis: Read through all existing website content to understand the business positioning, target audience, and unique value propositions
Competitive Context: Analyze the industry and identify visual opportunities that differentiate this business from competitors
User Journey Mapping: Identify critical decision points where users need additional confidence or clarity to proceed
Trust Signal Assessment: Determine what credibility markers this business needs to communicate visually

Technical Architecture Investigation

Codebase Analysis: Examine existing React components, shadcn/ui usage, and current design system patterns
Performance Baseline: Assess current loading speeds and identify optimal image integration points
Responsive Behavior: Understand existing breakpoints and responsive design patterns
Component Structure: Identify where images can be integrated without disrupting existing functionality

STEP 2: STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION
Primary Integration Targets (Prioritize by Impact)

Hero Section Enhancement - In 2025, hero sections are strategic elements designed to guide users, tell a story, and encourage action
Trust-Building Sections - Areas where credibility needs visual reinforcement
Service/Product Explanation Areas - Complex concepts that benefit from visual demonstration
Social Proof Zones - Sections that need emotional connection and authenticity

Decomposition Framework
Break down the challenge into specific strategic questions:

Trust Deficit Analysis: Where does the current website rely heavily on text to build trust?
Concept Complexity Assessment: Which services/products are difficult to understand without visuals?
Emotional Connection Gaps: Where could imagery create stronger emotional resonance?
Conversion Bottlenecks: Which pages/sections have high bounce rates that imagery could improve?

STEP 3: ADVANCED IMAGE GENERATION STRATEGY
Universal Image Requirements (No Faces Policy)

Human Elements: Hands, backs, silhouettes, partial figures from behind/side acceptable
Professional Compositions: Clean, sophisticated imagery that enhances brand credibility
Environmental Storytelling: Images that communicate expertise through context and details
Authentic Atmosphere: Professional settings that feel genuine rather than stock-photo generic

Business-Agnostic Prompt Framework
MASTER PROMPT TEMPLATE:

Generate a sophisticated, professional image using latest AI capabilities that enhances business credibility and user trust.

VISUAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:
- Resolution: 2400x1600 (hero placement) or 1200x800 (content sections)
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 for hero sections, 3:2 for content areas
- NO FACES (unless it shows clients): Human elements limited to hands, backs, silhouettes, or partial figures
- Professional lighting with natural depth and sophisticated shadows
- Clean, modern aesthetic with premium quality feel

STRATEGIC VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- [CONTEXT-SPECIFIC]: Professional environment relevant to business type
- [TRUST SIGNALS]: Visual cues that communicate competence and reliability
- [QUALITY INDICATORS]: Premium materials, advanced equipment, or skilled craftsmanship
- [ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT]: Workspace, tools, or setting that suggests expertise

COLOR PSYCHOLOGY:
- Primary: Trust-building colors (deep blues, warm grays, natural tones)
- Secondary: Industry-appropriate accent colors that reinforce brand positioning
- Lighting: Warm, inviting illumination that creates comfort while maintaining professionalism

COMPOSITIONAL STRATEGY:
- Rule of thirds with leading lines toward center of focus
- Negative space for text overlay compatibility
- Depth of field that creates professional photography aesthetic
- Environmental elements that tell a story about business quality/expertise

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Optimized for web delivery with progressive loading
- Responsive design compatibility across all device sizes
- Accessibility-friendly with clear contrast and descriptive potential
- Performance-optimized format (WebP with fallbacks)

BUSINESS RELEVANCE FILTER:
- Must communicate specific value proposition rather than generic industry imagery
- Should answer the question: "Why choose this business over competitors?"
- Visual elements must reinforce key business differentiators
- Imagery should reduce cognitive load and increase user confidence
STEP 4: STRATEGIC PLACEMENT & INTEGRATION
Hero Section Integration (2025 trends emphasize custom illustrations and eye-catching elements in hero sections)

Primary Impact Location: Where your analysis realized an image would be a significant improvement (for example hero, service, etc)
Integration Method: Seamlessly blend with existing Page and content
Responsive Behavior: Ensure image adapts perfectly across all device sizes
Performance Impact: Implement lazy loading and optimize delivery


Technical Implementation Standards

Component Integration: Use existing shadcn/ui patterns and design system
Performance Optimization: Implement Next.js Image component with proper optimization
Accessibility: Include descriptive alt text and proper ARIA labels
Loading Strategy: Progressive enhancement with skeleton states

STEP 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE & OPTIMIZATION
Self-Criticism Framework
Before finalizing any image integration, evaluate against these criteria:
Business Relevance Test:

Does this image specifically enhance THIS business's unique value proposition?
Could this image apply to any similar business, or is it uniquely relevant?
Will this image make potential customers more likely to choose this business?

Conversion Impact Analysis:

Does this image guide users toward desired actions?
Will this image reduce bounce rates and increase engagement?
Does this image address specific user concerns or questions?

Technical Excellence Check:

Does the image integrate seamlessly with existing design system?
Will this image maintain fast loading times across all devices?
Does the image enhance rather than distract from existing content?

Professional Standards Validation:

Does this image meet current professional web design standards?
Will this image enhance business credibility and trustworthiness?
Does this image feel custom and premium rather than generic?

STEP 6: IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTION
Code Integration Requirements

React Component Structure: Integrate images using existing component patterns
Responsive Design: Ensure proper behavior across all breakpoints
Performance Optimization: Implement proper lazy loading and image optimization
Accessibility Standards: Include proper alt text and ARIA labels

Testing & Validation

Visual Integration Test: Ensure seamless blend with existing design
Performance Impact Test: Verify loading times remain optimal
Responsive Behavior Test: Confirm proper display across all devices
Accessibility Compliance Test: Validate screen reader compatibility

SUCCESS METRICS & VALIDATION
Agent Mode Excellence Indicators

Deep Business Understanding: Demonstrates sophisticated analysis of business context and user needs
Strategic Visual Thinking: Each image has clear rationale based on conversion optimization
Technical Integration Mastery: Seamless integration with existing codebase and design systems
Premium Quality Output: Professional-grade imagery that enhances rather than detracts from business credibility

Final Deliverables

Strategic Analysis Report: Clear explanation of why specific images were chosen and where they're placed
